wp-fail2ban WordPress "must use" plugin.

This plugin is used to track WordPress login failures.  It can
be used to aggregate login failure reports accross many sites
to catch the "slow burn" WordPress attack bot armies and block them
with fail2ban.

This "must-use plugin" does not show up in the WordPress control panel
like other plugins.


Installation:

1. Create a mu-plugins directory in your wp-content directory
2. Copy wp-fail2ban.php to the mu-plugins directory.

Now you should start seeing "wordpress...Authentication" messages
logged in your system's syslog file, usuually /var/log/syslog or
something similar.  You may want to use your syslog config file to
direct these messages to a custom logfile.

Some sample log messages:

Nov 12 22:23:40 www7 wordpress(somesite.org)[28288]: Authentication failure for admin from 64.34.173.227
Nov 12 22:29:03 www7 wordpress(othersite.com)[30207]: Authentication failure for admin from 37.115.239.1
Nov 12 22:30:29 www7 wordpress(othersite.com)[30770]: Authentication failure for admin from 46.105.14.54
Nov 12 22:31:43 www7 wordpress(onemore.org)[31253]: Authentication succeeded for ValidUser from 191.91.143.220


The plugin logs both successful and unsuccessful logins.  Blocking the
brute force password attempts is the obvious use for this.  You might also
be able to detect patterns of misbehavior from the successful logins as
well.  (For example, seeing hundreds of successful logins per day might
to a site might indicate that they are being swamped with comment spam
from bots).
