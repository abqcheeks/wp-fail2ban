This plugin is used to track WordPress login failures.  It can
be used to aggregate login failure reports accross many sites
to catch the "slow burn" WordPress attack bot armies and block them
with fail2ban.

This "must-use plugin" does not show up in the WordPress control panel
like other plugins.

See INSTALL.txt for installation and integration instructions.
